# Ethereum overview

Deploying an Ethereum node with Chainstack provides you with a fully synchronized Ethereum node.

You can access the node through a WSS or an RPC endpoint.

Chainstack currently supports joining the following Ethereum networks:

* Mainnet — public Ethereum mainnet.
* Ropsten Testnet — public Ethereum testnet.

For development purposes on the Ropsten testnet, fund your accounts with Ropsten ETH at the [Ropsten faucet](https://faucet.ropsten.be/).
