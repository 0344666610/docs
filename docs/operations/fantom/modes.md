# Modes

Chainstack supports deploying a Fantom node on the mainnet in the following modes:

* Full node — a node that stores full blockchain data.
* Archive node — a node that stores full blockchain data and an archive of historical states.

To be a part of the Fantom mainnet, you can deploy either a full node or an archive node.
