# Public network node types

When deploying a node to the public network, you can choose between a dedicated and a shared node.

* Dedicated — deployed exclusively for the user.
* Shared — access to the node can be shared with other users.

As a rule of thumb, dedicated nodes are for production, while shared nodes are for development and testing.
