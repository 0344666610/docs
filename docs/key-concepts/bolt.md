# Bolt

A Chainstack patent pending node synchronization technology.

Chainstack does regular snapshots of the blockchain data and keeps the data in the platform's snapshot registry.

The platform restores the latest snapshot to every newly initiated node. As a result, every node deployed with Chainstack and Bolt syncs from the latest snapshot instead of from the genesis block.
