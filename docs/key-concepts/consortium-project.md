# Consortium project

A project to deploy a permissioned blockchain network.

See [Supported protocols](/platform/supported-protocols).

## Deployment

You can currently do a public cloud deployment only. In the future, you will be able to do a public cloud or a hybrid deployment.

### Public cloud

Launch a [consortium](/glossary#consortium) network on a public cloud.

See [Supported cloud hosting providers](/platform/supported-cloud-hosting-providers).

### Hybrid

Launch a [consortium](/glossary#consortium) network on a public cloud and on a private cloud. You can run a number of your Consortium network's nodes in a public cloud, and a number of the nodes from the same network [on-premises](/glossary#on-premises).

You can currently manually add your on-premises MultiChain nodes to the MultiChain network deployed with Chainstack. See [Deploying a hybrid MultiChain network](/operations/deploying-a-hybrid-multichain-network).
