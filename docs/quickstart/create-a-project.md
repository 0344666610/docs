# Create a project

In Chainstack, a project has a clearly defined business case and can contain one or more blockchain networks.

You must create a project to be able to deploy a node or a network, or to join a network.

To create a project:

1. Log in to your [Chainstack account](https://console.chainstack.com/).
1. Click **Create project**.
1. Click **Public chain** for an Ethereum node deployment, or **Consortium** for MultiChain or Quorum.
1. Provide **Project name** and optionally **Description**.
1. Click **Create**.

This will create a project.
