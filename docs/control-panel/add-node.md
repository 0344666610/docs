# Add a node to a network

Once you have [deployed a Consortium network](/control-panel/deploy-consortium-network) or [joined a Public chain](/control-panel/join-public-chain), you can add more nodes to the network.

To add a node:

1. Select the project with the network.
1. Select the network.
1. Click **Add node**.

The status will change from **Pending** to **Running** once deployed.
